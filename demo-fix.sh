echo "   1. ✅ Signing configuration handles missing production keystore gracefully"
echo "   2. ✅ Debug keystore fallback enables release builds for development"

echo "   4. ✅ Build instructions added in BUILD.md and README.md"
echo "   5. ✅ APKs generate in standard Gradle output directories"
echo "   6. ✅ All build variants (debug/release, oss/rs, all architectures) work"
